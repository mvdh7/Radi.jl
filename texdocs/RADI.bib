	abstract = {Use of Fick's First Law to estimate solute fluxes is arguably the most common and important calculation related to the geochemistry and environmental chemistry of fine-grained unlithified sediments. In such porous media, the diffusion coefficient in this law must be reduced by the square of the tortuosity to account for the longer diffusive paths. Experimental methods to estimate tortuosity are specialized or time consuming, and not routinely done. An analysis of available data shows that tortuosity, θ, is accurately correlated to readily measured porosity values, φ, through the simple relation: θ2=1−ln(φ2)..},

	abstract = {We investigated the composition, recycling, and mass accumulation rates of sediments along a transect in the Southern Ocean located from 66°S to 57°S at 170°W. This transect also corresponds to the location of a sediment trap mooring line. The sediments at the seven sites studied range from largely terrigenous material to nearly pure ({\textgreater}90\%) biogenic silica. CaCO3 is a minor but persistent component at most sites. Mass accumulation rates have been determined on the basis of excess 230Th in the sediments, i.e., 230Th-normalized accumulation rates. The influence of redistribution of sediments on the sea floor has been estimated from 14C analyses. The recycling of material delivered to the sediments has been characterized on the basis of pore water studies that make extensive use of both in situ sampling and shipboard extractions. The influence of the highly variable rates of input of particulate matter that characterize much of the Southern Ocean upon pore water gradients and fluxes across the sediment water interface has been considered. We find only poor correspondence between BSiO2 burial fraction (=burial/particulate flux), a quantifiable measure of preservation efficiency, and BSiO2 particulate rain along the transect. However, preservation does appear to be closely linked to a combination of sedimentation rate and particulate rain. The burial fraction of BSiO2 is small relative to benthic rain (5–19\%). Despite the small fraction buried, burial flux normalized to (sedimentation rate)1/2 appears to provide a very consistent means of predicting benthic particulate rain over a large range of rain rates, including data from a number of different studies and environments. At sites with BSiO2 rain ⩾250mmolm−2yr−1 the average difference between predicted and observed rain is 25–30\%. Such rain rates occur in many marine areas, particularly the Southern Ocean, with the result that this relationship potentially provides a means of estimating BSiO2 benthic rain over prolonged periods in the past on the basis of readily measured sediment parameters. At the southern-most deep ocean station, the particulate flux was characterized by an extremely high Corg/CaCO3 ratio ({\textgreater}10), but this high ratio does not appear to have a substantial influence on CaCO3 burial. CaCO3 is preserved in the sediments at this site despite a particulate flux with a 10-fold excess of Corg above that required for complete dissolution in the sediments. The unexpectedly high preservation of CaCO3 is due largely to the very steep Corg oxidation rate profile at this site. As a result, a large fraction of the organic matter oxidized in the sediments does so in close proximity to the sediment–water interface where most of the metabolic CO2 is neutralized by CO32− from the overlying water, rather than by the dissolution of sedimentary CaCO3. Diagenetic modeling indicates that at several of the stations, the remineralization fluxes of carbonate species across the sediment–water interface may not have been at steady state as a result of the highly pulsed nature of particulate rain in this environment. We estimate that at the time of our sampling it is possible that near-interface fluxes could have been a factor of 1.6–2 times the annual average. At every site on the transect, the burial fluxes of detrital material are substantially greater than the detrital particulate rain measured in the sediment traps, by as much as a factor of 40. Detrital burial is bimodal, being greatest at the southern and northern extremes of the transect. We postulate that the excess of burial over particulate rain in the south reflects the contribution of ice rafted debris at these high latitudes. Increases in the supply at the northern stations must have a different source. We believe that the excess at these stations is material eroded from the sea floor to the west, possibly on the Campbell Plateau, and advected by currents to the northern portion of the transect at depths below the shallow traps.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for oxic and anoxic diagenesis of shallow and deep-sea sediments based on an efficient solver for steady state pore water and solid phase diffusion/reaction/advection equations. The model, called “Muds”, is orders of magnitude faster than solvers of the corresponding time-dependent equations. The model resolves Mn and Fe/S geochemistry as well as pore water pH and CaCO3 dissolution. The model speed opens application possibilities that are impossible for time-dependent models, including automatic tuning of uncertain parameters, and deployment of the model in gridded global domains. The kinetic rate constants for respiration and bioturbation are parameterized as functions of the organic carbon rain to the seafloor, based on existing parameterizations in the literature. Seven uncertain model parameters, including many of the rate constant parameterizations, were tuned to minimize the misfit to observations from 53 sedimentary locations throughout the ocean. The model tuning knobs were the fractions of labile and refractory organic matter in the sedimenting material, the NO3−, Mn, Fe, and S respiration rate constant parameterizations, and the depth scales of respiration and of pore water irrigation. We searched for adequate fit values of these parameterizations using a simulated annealing method. The cost function (degree of misfit) was based on a comparison of pore water (NO3−, NH4+, Mn2+, and Fe2+) and solid phase (organic carbon and MnO2) model results with data. Many of the tuning parameters are constrained to ±50\% or better. The model is most skillful at predicting organic carbon concentration, depth of NO3− penetration, and pore water Fe2+, and less so for Mn2+, NH4+, and solid phase MnO2. The model misses some of the very high sediment surface MnO2 concentrations observed in, for example, the California Borderlands. We believe that these sites must receive a higher input of reactive Mn than the crustal abundance of the clay rain. The model was deployed on every 2° × 2° grid point below 1000 m of the global seafloor, using gridded maps of organic carbon rain to the seafloor and overlying water chemistry. The deep-sea carbon burial efficiency is 7\%, with 95\% of respiration by oxic metabolism. The model was also run against a new depth-oxygen hypsometry of the global ocean, with sediment area as a function of overlying oxygen concentration and average depth related to carbon fluxes, to include the effects of shallow water sediments. This analysis predicts that shallow waters ({\textless}1000 m) account for 88\% of respiration, and oxygen accounts for 66\% of respiration overall. Denitrification is closely coupled to organic nitrogen fluxes to the sediment, and the global rate is estimated to be 1.4 × 1014 mol yr−1, a factor of 6–8 higher than the corresponding estimate from Middelburg et al. [1996], throwing the nitrogen cycle in the ocean into imbalance.},
